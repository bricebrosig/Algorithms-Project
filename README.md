# 4110-Project
Brice Brosig and Jon Wendt
Algorithm that updates the minimum spanning tree of a graph when edges are are added or deleted.
The goal is to determine, emperically, wether the time to update the MST depends more-so on the action (add/delete)
or the size of the tree. Or even both.

# Compiling

Use the makefile. This will include all the flags and dependencies that you can't be bothered with. 
Compiles to a bin folder so check that out for running the program.

Kruskal code was got from geeks for geeks. Modified slightly to suit the nature of this program.
